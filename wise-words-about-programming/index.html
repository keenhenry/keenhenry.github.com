<article class="ten columns offset-by-four">
  <p>Here I copied the words of Joe Armstrong on learning programming:</p>

<p>Old timer here …</p>

<p>When I learnt programming (1967) , I could choose between FORTRAN and 
(it was rumoured, Algol) but nobody knew anything about Algol so it was FORTRAN.</p>

<p>The turn round time for a program was three weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>week 1 - write code on paper forms - send to computer center to be turned into punched cards</li>
  <li>week 2 - review punched cards, if ok send to machine</li>
  <li>week 3 - results</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler helpfully stopped at the first syntax error which got you back
to week 1 - so if you had say ten errors in your program it would take 30 weeks 
to get it running.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good environment - teaches you not to make mistakes and to
think first.</p>

<p>By about 1970 I was at university and turn round times were down to 4 hours
and you could punch your own cards - it was still FORTRAN</p>

<p>By 1974 I got access to a computer – a honywell DDP516 - with a colossal
32 KB memory. So the 474 pass FORTRAN compiler could compile a hundred line program in
less than a week (or so …).</p>

<p>Things improved - I went to CERN and used the CRAY1 this could compile 100K
lines of FORTRAN in 1 picosecond (ie about a zillion times slower than my mobile phone today).</p>

<p>Still Fortran.</p>

<p>In 1974 (ish) I got to play with a DEC10 - Now I could write FORTRAN,
Basic, assembler and it had time-sharing (wow) turn round times of seconds. If I’d been In
the USA I’d be Bill Gates, but this was Edinburgh.</p>

<p>In 1976 I got a job programming a NORD10 in FORTRAN/Assembler and it was
really fast turn round times of seconds.</p>

<p>In 1980 ish I was still programming in FORTRAN - I forget the name of the
machine all files were in one directory, no full-screen editor, no revision control
system, I wrote about 150K lines of FORTRAN for it.</p>

<p>1985 I joined Ericsson - wow a VAX11/750 - new languages to learn. Bye bye FORTRAN.</p>

<p>I learnt (with various degrees of proficiency) Lisp, Prolog, awk, bash,
smalltalk, TCL, and became proficient in Prolog (aggghhh - the beauty ….).</p>

<p>I also played with just about any language I could get my hands on (ML, forth, …).</p>

<p>Then I (1986) got into my Erlang Phase (I couldn’t really learn Erlang,
‘cos it didn’t exist, so I invented it) - it was really an outgrowth of Prolog+Smalltalk 
with a bit of error recovery concurrency and distribution throw in.</p>

<p>Then I learnt (badly) C - But Mike Williams said my C was crap and looked
like Fortran so he binned my C … (why use malloc and free and pointers anyway …).</p>

<p>I saw C++ coming and read the book - or at least tried to read the book -
there’s a dent in the wall behind my piano, where the book hit the wall - Improvements to
C should make things easier not more complicated, I thought.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>I tried Java (not impressed, ok it’s better than C++, but oh so verbose, I
used to get programmers “white fingers” when programming FORTRAN you have to write
hundreds of lines to do the smallest thing - Java seemed similar - so verbose) - I also
(later) tried Python (ok), Ruby (ok), Lua(better), Javascript(I like :-)</p>

<p>It’s actually taken me quite a long time to learn all these languages, and
they didn’t all come at once. I had a good 15 years of FORTRAN - long enough to get
good at it, 10 years of Prolog, 20 years of Erlang etc.</p>

<p>I also had a long time to assimilate the new ideas - the ideas in
programming come pretty slowly - once every twenty years or so somebody has a really 
good idea, programming today hasn’t improved much in the last 20 years - it was mess 
then and it’s still a mess.</p>

<p>IDE’s and revision control systems have just made matters worse - now you
have all the old versions of the mess as well as the mess itself, and the IDE means you
can’t even see the mess.</p>

<p>The best IDE in the world is your BRAIN - it’s a zillion times better than
these clicky things.</p>

<p>What’s this got to do with education?</p>

<p>Suppose you’re starting off.</p>

<p>You can choose between twenty odd languages (all of them good for one
reason or another) what took me 40 years to learn, you must try to understand 
in 2-3 years, this is just not possible.</p>

<p>What languages should a beginner learn, what languages should a school teach?</p>

<p>Now we get to the paradox of choice - because there are so many
alternatives it becomes impossible to choose.</p>

<p>Old timers say “choose the language appropriate to the problem” when you
know 20 odd languages (with varying degrees of proficiency) this is easy to say - but
If you know two languages Java and C then this isn’t much help.</p>

<p>There are literally problems where the solution in a CLP language is a few
lines and is thousands of lines in C.</p>

<p>What would I recommend learning?</p>

<pre><code>- C
- Prolog
- Erlang (I'm biased)
- Smalltalk
- Javascript
- Hakell / ML /OCaml
- LISP/Scheme/Clojure
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of years should be enough (PER LANGUAGE).</p>

<p>Notice there is no quick fix here - if you want a quick fix go buy “learn
PHP in ten minutes” and spend the next twenty years googling for “how do I compute 
the length of a string”.</p>

<p>The crazy think is we still are extremely bad at fitting things together -
still the best way of fitting things together is the unix pipe</p>

<pre><code>find ... | grep | uniq | sort | ...
</code></pre>

<p>and the <strong>fundamental</strong> reason for this is that components should be separated
by well-defined protocols in a universal intermediate language.</p>

<p>Fitting things together by message passing is the way to go - this is basis
of OO programming - but done badly in most programming languages.</p>

<p>If ALL applications in the world were interfaced by (say) sockets + lisp S
expressions and had the semantics of the protocol written down in a formal notation -
then we could reuse things (more) easily.</p>

<p>Today there is an unhealthy concentration on language and efficiency and
NOT on how things fit together and protocols - teach protocols and not
languages.</p>

<p>And teach ALGORITHMS.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>/Joe</p>

<p>(The dates in the above are approximate)</p>
