title: Determine orientation of a polygon
category: algorithms
---

In [this](http://keenhenry.me/polygon-area-alorithm/) article, I explained that the by-product of calculating area is
an indication of the orientation of a polygon. However, if you only want to calculate orientation, the algorithm for
calculating area is overkill and not efficient. How can we do better?
