Budapest is indeed an interesting city. What's so interesting about this city is not how rich it is, but how simple.


Some facts about this trip:

First time visiting an eastern european country.
First time taking Wizz airline.
First time using Hungarian Forint.
First time swiming in Europe.
First time taking thermal hot baths in Europe.
First time visiting river Danube.
First time visiting Lake Balaton - the largest lake in central Europe.

Spent less than 400 euros in this trip, including airline tickets, hotels, traffic and food.

First impression about budapest: 

old, dirty, not as rich as western europe. Now I understand why a danish guy once called western Europe as

Our schedule in this trip:

- First day
- Second day
- third day
- fourth day
- Fifth day

After a few days stay, my impression becomes:
