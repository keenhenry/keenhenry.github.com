title: Must-have Vim Plugins
category: vim
---

After one month of struggling with PLAIN VIM, I finally made up my minds to make my VIM experience more friendly and more
IDE-oriented. As a result, I did some research and experimented with varies plugins and finally came to a conclusion:

> 1. You must use Vim with _exuberant ctags_ (make sure _ctags_ is installed before that).
> 2. Install plugin [_Taglist_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273) to help Vim tag advanges of _ctags_.
> 3. Configure _ctags_ in your `.ctags` file in your home directory to make ctags fit for your special needs. 
> 4. Install plugin [_NERDTree_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) to help you browser your project directories more quickly within Vim.
> 5. Install plugin [_SnipMate_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) to save you some time on typing repetitive codes in Vim.
> 6. Install plugin [_TComment_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1173) to comment out codes quickly in Vim.
> 7. Make some more configurations in your `.vimrc` file to make those plugins work like a charm.

Now, my Vim editor has become a powerful IDE, and I am turning myself into a real programmer. Happy Vim hacking!
