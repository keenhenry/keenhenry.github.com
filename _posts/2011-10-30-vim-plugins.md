After one month of struggling with PLAIN VIM, I made up my minds to make my VIM experience smoother and more
IDE-oriented. After some research and experiment with varies plugins, here is my conclusion:

1. Make sure _exuberant ctags_ is installed.
2. Install plugin [_Taglist_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273) so Vim can make use of _ctags_.
3. Configure _ctags_ in your `.ctags` file in home directory to fit your needs. 
4. Install plugin [_NERDTree_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) to mimic GUI-like directory browsing in Vim.
5. Install plugin [_SnipMate_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) to save time on typing in Vim.
6. Install plugin [_TComment_](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1173) to (un)comment codes quickly in Vim.
7. Configure those plugins in `.vimrc` to make them work like charms.

Now, look what my Vim editor has become - a powerful IDE! I am turning myself into a real programmer. 

Happy Vim hacking!
